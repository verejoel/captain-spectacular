    "#\n",
    "# Specific heat due to phonons is related to phonon density of states by \n",
    "# the integral transform:\n",
    "#\n",
    "#     Cv(T) = int_0^infty [dw D(w) K(w,T)]\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Cv - heat capacity at constant volume\n",
    "# T - temperature\n",
    "# R - gas constant\n",
    "# w - phonon frequency\n",
    "# D(w) - phonon density of states (DOS)\n",

    "# One first discretizes the DOS by defining \n",

    "# The kernel matrix K is given by\n",

    "# Therefore we have an (m by 1) input vector of (T_i, Cv_i) tuples, and\n",

    "# raw input data consists of a vector containing (T_i, Cv_i) tuples (m observations in total)\n",
